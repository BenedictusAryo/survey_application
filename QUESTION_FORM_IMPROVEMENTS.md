# Question Form Improvements

## Overview
The question creation form has been significantly improved to provide a more user-friendly interface, similar to Google Forms, with better handling of question types and options.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Options Interface
- **Before**: Required manual JSON input for all question types, even text and numeric inputs
- **After**: Options interface only appears for question types that actually need options
- **Supported Types**: `single_select`, `multi_select`, `image_select`

### 2. Google Forms-Like Experience
- Live preview of the question as you type
- Dynamic addition/removal of options with intuitive UI
- Visual feedback for question types
- Better form validation

### 3. Smart Form Behavior
- Options field automatically shows/hides based on question type
- Automatic value generation from text if no custom value provided
- Real-time preview updates
- Improved error handling

## Question Types and Options

| Question Type | Requires Options | UI Behavior |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| `text_input` | ❌ No | Options section hidden |
| `numeric_input` | ❌ No | Options section hidden |
| `date_input` | ❌ No | Options section hidden |
| `image_prompt` | ❌ No | Options section hidden |
| `single_select` | ✅ Yes | Options section visible with radio preview |
| `multi_select` | ✅ Yes | Options section visible with checkbox preview |
| `image_select` | ✅ Yes | Options section visible with image option support |

## New Features

2. `forms/views.py` - Updated views to handle dynamic options
3. `templates/forms/question_form.html` - Completely redesigned interface

- Automatic value generation if not provided
- Proper JSON storage in database

### Frontend Features
- CSS styling for better UX
- JavaScript for dynamic form behavior
- Responsive design

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```

This will create sample questions and verify that:

- Database storage is correct

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Drag-and-drop option reordering
